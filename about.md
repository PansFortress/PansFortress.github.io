My name is Jason. I live in New York City in a small apartment with my beautiful and supportive girlfriend surrounded by a well organized collection of board games.

In a past life, I had a wonderfully challenging job as a Project Manager for a small startup in the online advertising space which went public and grew its team to something I never could have imagined. I went off to learn the ropes of being a software engineer at one of the world's largest banks hoping not to cause the next global incident. I'm now at the New York Times working as Program Manager for the teams building the application to deliver our journalism across the web.

My first taste of development was in high school building dynamic 2D games in Java SE 6 thanks to the most patient and creative teacher I have ever met, Mr Turner. I then spent some odd years in college taking a lot of theory courses, traversing trees in C++, and not making time for myself for creative projects. As a regretful adult, I'm now attempting to make up for my past sins by trying to re-master simple SQL, UNIX and Java. At the same time I hope to learn more about the Python and Javascript languages while digging deeper into various popular frameworks and libraries. 

This blog is about my love-hate relationship with software development. It will mostly likely be filled with nonsense related to solving simple problems that I spent days or weeks on, issues only a New Yorker would be upset about, or my latest board game obsession. 

I hope as a reader you're able to enjoy this weird space I've carved out for myself on the internet and find something of value here. Please don't ever hesitate to join the conversation by writing in the comments or dropping me some mail.
